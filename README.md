# Bicycle Rear View Vision

Project Description

Our team decided that we wanted to work on a project that would improve safety for bicyclists. After reviewing multiple proposals and options, we settled on the development of a visual recognition system that would warn the cyclist if a vehicle was approaching from behind. The most basic version of our solution would consist of a rear facing camera, attached to a Raspberry Pi single board computer, powered by a LiPO battery pack. A simple buzzer attached to the Piâ€™s GPIO pins would alert the rider when a vehicle was approaching.
After building and testing the initial minimum viable prototype, the team was able to identify a large number of potential enhancments and new features that will be persued in future releases of the product. We hope to reduce power consumption, streamline model performance and, to reduce the size and weight of the product.
